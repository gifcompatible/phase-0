# 1.1 Thinking About Time
I clicked on about 10 of the videos/articles, but the time management/productivity techniques that interest me the most are the Pomodoro technique and meditation, specifically mindful meditation.  "Time Boxing" is essentially the same as the Pomodoro technique; you set aside a specific length of time in which your objective is to complete some task, and then step away for it for a bit before coming back to it, again for a set amount of time.  You continue to work on the task for each set chunk of time until you've completed it.  I believe this strategy will be awesome for helping to eliminate burnout from overthinking the challenges in Phase 0, and for me I am going to try working in some meditation in the breaks in between time boxes/pomodoros.  I currently manage my time by working on things one of two ways: 1) I keep at it until it's done, not stopping at all (e.g. marathoning tv shows/video games) or 2) I set aside a certain amount of time to work on something before switching gears into something else (I typically do this when I'm reading a long book or a massive stack of comics).  I absolutely will be implementing meditation and time boxing/pomodoros.  For my meditations, I plan on using the Headspace app and meditating at least once in the morning when I get up to focus on a goal for the day, and then at night focusing on my accomplishments, and then also possibly in between pomodoros, focusing on my overall task.  I'm really looking forward to trying this whole plan out; I've been wanting to start meditating for ages and I already basically use time boxing/pomodoros so it should be easy to utilize that strategy to further focus my DBC coursework.

## 1.2 The Command Line
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?" **The interpreter for the command language.**
2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? **Honestly, it wasn't the material itself so much as the way the website is structured...it was annoying to have to click back to the home page to get to the next lesson instead of there being a "next" button at the bottom of the page or something like that.**
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? **I believe so.**
4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? **"Wildcard" (*) and "cd".**
5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does. **Full disclosure-I submitted this already but it didn't take, so this will be the second time I'm typing this.  Anyway:**
pwd>present working directory

ls>list directory

mv>move or change file name

cd>change directory

../>position in path of directory

touch>create a new file

mkdir>make a new directory

less>display file contents

rmdir>remove directory

rm>remove

help>displays a list of commands
### 1.4 Forking and Cloning
Step 1: Log in to GitHub

Step 2: Create a new repository by clicking the plus sign next to your name in the upper right and selecting New Repository

Step 3: Enter a name for the repo, choose public/private, choose a license, and click Create Repository

Step 4: Navigate to the repo you want to fork

Step 5: Click Fork in the upper right and then copy the URL next to where it says Find File

Step 6: In your terminal, navigate to the folder you wish to clone the repo to

Step 7: Type "git clone [URL of the forked repo]" and hit enter

Step 8: High five yourself BECAUSE YOU JUST FORKED AND CLONED THE SH&T OUT OF THAT REPO



I think the main reason to fork a repo rather than create a new one is that you don't have to start from scratch-if you find something that is similar enough to what you were planning to create, it makes more sense to fork it that start from scratch.  I derped and had not created a folder for phase0 goodies, but other than that it was fairly easy to set up git and GitHub.  Full disclosure-I've had a GitHub account for a few months and have also submitted some pull requests etc. for Hacktoberfest, so I was already fairly familiar with forking/cloning/git in general.
