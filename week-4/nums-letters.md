**What does puts do?**

It writes on the screen everything that comes after the word "puts".


**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is a number without a decimal point; a float is the opposite.


**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

It has to do with the result-float division will give you the "right answer", including a remainder that follows a decimal point, and an integer will give you a realistic answer, so if there would be a remainder it will round the answer down.  If you think of division of children-perhaps in a strange alt-world, you can have 4.5 children, but realistically you can only have 4 children.  4.5 would be the result of float division (the correct answer) and 4 is the result of integer division (the realistic answer).


```ruby puts (365*24)```
```ruby puts (24*60) * (365*10)```

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

You input the number as a numeric value, and then can use the symbols +, -, *, / respectively to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.


**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are groups of values contained between single or double quotes.  Strings can be contain letters, numbers, spaces, etc.  Strings are good for using with variables-you can set a variable equal to a string so that you don't have to keep typing it over and over again.


**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

A local variable is an object you define-for example, you can have my_variable="me", which basically says that when you type my_variable, it is equated to the string value "me", so you will see "me" when you type "my_variable."  I answered why and when you would use them above.


**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

It was good-the "Learn to Program" text is really interesting and more helpful than Codecademy was in explaining these concepts.  This was a good review while also learning a few new things!
