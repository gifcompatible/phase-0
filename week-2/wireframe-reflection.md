**What is a wireframe?**

Wireframe is a way of getting the hierarchy of the site set up.


**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing makes it easier to make the layout of the site, as well as seeing how the user will interface with it.


**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**


It was pretty cool!  I don't know if I'd call it enjoyable, though.


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I did revise it.  I roughly laid it out, and then liked it more after moving some things around.


**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I'm not sure how to answer this question-in terms of Googling, I looked up some markdown tips, but with regards to wireframing, I didn't really ask any questions/look up any resources.  I had a plan pretty much as soon as I learned what wireframing was.  Once I chose a tool to use, I was off and running.


**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I liked determining how I would structure my hierachy and thinking about what would be appealing for site users.  I found the actual wireframing to be tedious, mainly because click and drag using a trackpad is not fun.
