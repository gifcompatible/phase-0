**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
My site will primarily be a professional site that features my work, hobbies/passions, blog, projects, and background.
**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
My target audience is looking to learn about technology/coding.  Through the blog and my projects, I hope to provide good learning content to the audience.
**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
I would primarily like for people to see my portfolio.
**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
They go hand in hand-a good user experience can be directly linked with a user-centered design.  In other words, decisions related to design should be made with the user in mind.
**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
It is how someone feels when they interface with a system.  This is valuable because user experience (UX) will determine how likely someone will be to want to use the system again
**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
I wouldn't say that I found any part of the challenge to be tedious, however, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why my site map image wasn't coming up...I hadn't committed the image!!
