<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Very cool!  It was awesome getting to run the code and see the site come together.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Not too bad.  We learned some cool things along the way.  While some elements are pretty self-explanatory (e.g. <footer> for footer), others didn't make much sense (<hr> for adding a line?).


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think we did well.  Mainly because we wanted to keep it simple and not worry about centering and what not, which I think helped cut down on time/headaches.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It's pretty easy to remember the formatting (right now at least), which is good.  I can't think of anything that seems bad about it, though.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

All bodies have a head on top, and some of them like to where DOCTYPE HTML hats.  Every opening tag has a twin closing tag.  That's all I have for now.
