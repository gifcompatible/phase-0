    <h1>Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h1>

    <strong>Version control</strong> is similar to having multiple saves in a video   game instead of one save file you overwrite; it allows you to see when you saved, what you were doing when you saved, and you can go back to that save if you mess up later in the game.  Version control is not just used by developers-it can be used for any number of things to keep track of overall progress on a project.  The great thing about version control is that it helps prevent fatal mistakes from being made.  Think of it as a series of do-overs.

        Once we have completed our desired changes and updates, we can use git to commit and push our code to our GitHub repository. <strong>GitHub</strong> is a web service that allows individuals and teams to manage projects and to collaborate and contribute to one another's projects in a nondestructive way. GitHub is useful because it stores the code so that it can be accessed and edited by others using what are called "forks". Forks allow one to copy the code of another for the purpose of adding or, in some cases perhaps, removing features. GitHub maintains extensive records of every new "commit" or update, who did it and any comments or descriptions about that particular action. It is easy to develop a timeline of changes and the thinking and personalities involved. GitHub also functions as social media, where one can view the projects and contributions of other users. This is concept is playing a larger and larger role in the fiding work in the software development industry, as it is easy for potential employers to see the projects a prospective employee has completed.

    What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    head, body, main, section, p, article.  <head> and <body> are crucial elements for entering any following html code that will be input.  <main> is good for laying out the main content of the site, which was perfect in this case given that the sample blog text we used was the main content of the page.  <article> is great for opening up an article posting on site, so it's perfect for blog posts.  <section> is good to section out portions of the article, however, I can see using that and <p> interchangeably at times.

    How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    They are laid out in the order they fall in the hierarchy of html elements.  They are ordered as follows: <head>, <body>, and then the order is based on the hierarchy within the body.

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    How to create a snippet!  It was cool to see that Sublime doesn't just interpret text, but that it has some cool shortcuts built in.  I may use snippets in the future now that I know how easy it is to make them!  I'm sure if I find myself typing the same content a few times I will definitely check if a snippet already exists, and if not I just might make one!
