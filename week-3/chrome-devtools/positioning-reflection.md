    **How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

    Chrome's DevTools inspector allows you to format and position elements while getting to see the changes you make in real-time.  This allows you to see if you are on the right track to seeing if your thought process was right without worrying about messing up your code.  Changes are cleared out with a refresh, so if you make some error it's easy to undo.


    **How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

    You can resize elements on the DOM by manipulating height and width.


    **What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

    The main differences in position have to do with how the elements will be positioned when compared to themselves.  Static positioning keeps the element where it would flow in the page, absolute keeps it in one spot despite how the page is moved, relative positions the element where it would be relative to itself, and fixed keeps the element in one spot and moves it in that spot with the page (for example, when scrolling it will scroll with the page).  Fixed and relative were pretty easy to use.  Static is seldom used unless you don't want the element to be in a specific spot, and absolute gets very tricky very quickly...


    What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

    Margins are the space between the element and other elements, padding is the spacing within the container of the element, and the border is the what surrounds the container.

    What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

    Some parts were pretty fun and cool to see how to position/format elements on the page, while others were very frustrating, but useful to know.  For example, the exercise where we had to make one of the divs into a sidebar...a little confusing, but uselful for creating a sidebar in the future!
