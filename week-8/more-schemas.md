This is a one-to-one relationship because crayons only have one brand.  So basically, each crayon in a box can have a different name, a different color, but within that box they are the same brand.

**What is a one-to-one database?
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

A one-to-one database shows a relationship of one row on each table.  You use a one-to-one database when there is a unique relationship between tables; when there is nothing else those rows would have a relationship with.

**What is a many-to-many database?
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

A many-to-many database shos a relationship between many items on each table.  You would use that when there is a common thing in each table that could be associated with many other things.

**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**

It's definitely hard to see when one-to-one relationships would be useful as opposed to just keeping that item in the original table at this point.  I do understand why many-to-many relationships are useful, though.
